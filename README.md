# Golang

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable and efficient software.

We do not need heavy softwares to run the program. We only need two softwares:-
1. IDE (eg Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc)
2. Compiler (golang compiler)

You can download these softwares from :-
1. Notepad++ - https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.7.1.html 
2. Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
3. Go Compiler - https://golang.org/dl/

Where to run and write your go code ?
1. Write your the code in any IDE and then save the code using .go extension.
2. Open cmd and locate the directory where you saved your code and type "go run filename.go".
